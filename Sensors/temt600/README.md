# TEMT6000

TEMT6000 is an ambient **ANALOG**  light sensor. It is sensitive to visible light much like the human eye and has peak sensitivity at 570 nm.

It help you to to detect the light density and reflect the analog voltage signal back to ESP/Arduino controller. You can set the threshold of voltage level to trigger other units on your ESP32 project.
